# Introduction
This is a project from my IT course where me and other colleges challenged ourselves to implement some features arround the Java, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS technologies. Overall, this is an application and website for a fictional Real State Agency. We were told to make a Java application that allows the user to insert a property into a database. For the Website, the user could only see all properties uploaded. In other words, the Java application uploads registers in the database and files in the FTP server, meanwhile the web application only read those informations.
